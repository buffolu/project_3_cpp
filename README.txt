note about thug attacking peasant:
insturctions were not completly clear, so to clarify:

if a thug attemps to attack a peasant and one of the 3 conditons are not met : thug would lose -1hp.

if a thug attemps to attack a peasant and peasant is close enough and no knights are around only then will
the peasant lose -1hp.


attack on peasant is done in the timeframe, meaning that you dont have to type go to make the attack happen.
